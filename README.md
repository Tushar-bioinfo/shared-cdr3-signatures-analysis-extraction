# CDR3 Motif Survival

A Python-based pipeline for identifying shared high-frequency CDR3 amino acid (AA) motifs from tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte repertoires and evaluating their association with overall survival across multiple cancer types.

This project was developed to support the analysis presented in [Your Manuscript Title Here], focused on short motif recurrence in TRB and IGH repertoires from CPTAC-3 tumor RNA-seq datasets.

## Overview

This repository contains all scripts and workflows required to:
- Extract k-mer motifs (4–11mers) from tumor-derived CDR3 AA sequences.
- Identify shared motifs across cancer types based on top-frequency ranks.
- Construct patient-level binary motif matrices.
- Integrate clinical survival data (OS time, vital status).
- Perform Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.
- Visualize motif enrichment using heatmaps and survival curves.
